# MetReLoad
Python application for downloading meteorological reanalysis data

## Installation

Python 3 is required. A [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)  or a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended. 

Install required packages with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Install MetReLoad with

    pip install [-e] .

Use the `-e` switch if you want an editable copy (for development).

## Usage

    metreload [OPTIONS] COMMAND [OPTIONS]...

### General options

```
--version  Show version and exit
--debug    Set debug mode on
--help     Show this message and exit.
```
  
See documentation in folder `docs` for more information.

## Contributing

Install development requirements into your current Python environment with

    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_dev.txt

Alternatively, if you are using `conda` you can also create a new development environment with

    conda env create --file conda/develop.yml --name <NAME>

Install the package in editable mode with

    pip install -e .

Before committing, run tests with

    python setup.py test

### Building with PyInstaller

PyInstaller version 3.4 is required. Excute 

    pyinstaller [-y] metreload.spec

to build an executable distribution into `dist/metreload`. (Use the `-y` switch to bypass confirmation for replacing old files.)
